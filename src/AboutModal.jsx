              Shortly after 50-aâ€”the statue in New York state shielding police disciplinary records from the public, was repealed, ProPublica
              <a href='https://www.propublica.org/article/nypd-civilian-complaint-review-board-editors-note' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">published over 12,000
              records</a> of civilian complaints filed against New York City police officers on July 26, 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>NYPD Complaints</em> was a project started to complement and augment the <a href='https://projects.propublica.org/nypd-ccrb/' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">ProPublica project</a> with
              data visualizations and query tools to let us further understand more about who the alleged abuses were coming from and the communities they affected.
            </p>
            <p>
              ProPublica obtained these records from the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB). It's important to note that this data only
              includes closed cases of officers that <em>are still on the force</em>, and had <em>at least one substantiated allegation</em> against them.
